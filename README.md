# PortScanner
Python program to determine which ports are open or closed in the local host. 

Port Scanners are primarily used for Penetration Testing and Information Gathering. Essentially, we are looking for open ports in a host for one of two reasons. To ensure our servers are secure or to exploit those of someone else. An unnecessarily opened port means vulnerability and comes with a lack of security.

Therefore, it is reasonable to scan the ports of your own network in order to spot potential security gaps. We will code our own port scanner in Python.
